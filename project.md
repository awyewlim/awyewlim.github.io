<h3><a href="https://github.com/awyewlim/Nonsensical-Appellationr">Meaningless Name Generator</a></h3>
<h6><i>Python, Machine Learning, NLP</i></h6>
<p>
This project is to build a sequence model that generate random meaningless name from scratch as my very first NLP project. I will build another model with better performance using Tensorflow later on. Stay tuned!
<br>
Dataset : From google search

<h3><a href="https://github.com/awyewlim/Manufacturing-Defects-Detector">Manufacturing Defects Detector</a></h3>
<h6><i>Python, Keras, OpenCV, Flask</i></h6>
<p>
This project is developed for datathon. The aim of this datathon is to design and develop an AI toolkit that can detect manufacturing defects automatically with suitable image processing and computer vision techniques. I use convolutional neural network (CNN) to train the model and deploy it to web with Flask for testing.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/awyewlim/Facial-Expression-Recognition">Facial Expression Recognition</a></h3>
<h6><i>Python, Keras, OpenCV, Flask</i></h6>
<p>
This project is to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories. (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)

<h3><a href="https://github.com/awyewlim/Sentiment-Analysis-IMDB">Sentiment Analysis IMDB</a></h3>
<h6><i>Python, Scikit-Learn, NLTK</i></h6>
<p>
This project is to analyze movie reviews from dataset using a simple logistic regression estimator from scikit-learn. NLTK is also used to perform feature extraction.
<br>
Dataset : IMDB

<h3><a href="https://github.com/awyewlim/Webale-Chess-Game">Webale Chess Game</a></h3>
<h6><i>java, javax</i></h6>
<p>
This project is to build another type of chess game as university assignment. Webale chess is a special type of chess game with different rules and is played on a 7x8 board. It is implemented as a GUI-based Java Application based on the requirement of university assignment. Currently, it only supports two humans as players, will consider to build an AI player as opponent if having time.

<h3><a href="https://github.com/awyewlim/Process-Scheduling">OS Process Scheduling</a></h3>
<h6><i>java</i></h6>
<p>

This project is to build simulations of three CPU scheduling algorithms that is Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First, Non-Preemptive Priority, Preemptive Shortest Job First as university assignment.
